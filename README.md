## License & Ownership

- In a nutshell our intention is to be dmocratic about the knowlege we possess and share it with our community. thus why we utilize Opensource/Copyleft style liesing for code and documentation published in this repository.
- Due to the state of the global cyberspace security stage, and the attacks focused on UCaaS operattors, there might be some cases where making some knowledge public before the comunity has had the change to react, could be potentially disastrous. Although security through obscurity is never a good idea, visibility to published data might be temporarly restricted at the projects core contriutors discretion, either by setting the data behind an "Authentication/Authorization" wall, or other similar type of access control capability, with the intent to reduce the risk of data abuse,  and widespread system compromise.
- Please Check out [Licesing](#TODO) speifc page for details on the ownership, licesing and copyright rights of all the data published here.
